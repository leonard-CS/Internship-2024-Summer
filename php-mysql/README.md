# Learning PHP + MySQL + Docker + Docker Compose

## Access Your Application
Once the containers are up and running, you can access your PHP application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8080`. You should see "Connected successfully" if everything is set up correctly.

## Database Access
You can access the MySQL database using a MySQL client with the following credentials:

- Host: `localhost` (or `mysql` if connecting from within another Docker container)
- Port: `3306`
- User: `myuser`
- Password: `mypassword`
- Database: `mydatabase`
